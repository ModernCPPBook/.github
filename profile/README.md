## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the GitHub repo of the [book](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031543685) "Parallel C++: Efficient and Scalable High-Performance Parallel Programming (using HPX)".

We will provide supplementary materials, including the C++ source code and Jupyter Notebook for all [examples](https://github.com/ModernCPPBook/Examples) in the book.

We will post posts on our [blog](https://hpxbook.stellar-group.org/) showing exmaples with upcoming C++ features mentioned in the outlook. 

As carefully we proofread the book, there will be always some bugs or issues which we will collect in the [Addendum](https://hpxbook.stellar-group.org/addendum/2024/08/15/addendum.html).
