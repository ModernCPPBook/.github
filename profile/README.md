Welcome to the GitHub repo of the [book](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031543685) "Parallel C++: Efficient and Scalable High-Performance Parallel Programming (using HPX)".

We will provide supplementary materials, including the C++ source code and Jupyter Notebook for all [examples](https://github.com/ModernCPPBook/Examples) in the book.
